  Dairy producers are feeding dairy calves more milk before weaning, as research
  has demonstrated that greater milk consumption provides short- and long-term
  benefits for calves. Encouraging solid feed consumption by calves on high-milk
  diets, however, can be challenging. Researchers have concluded that gradual
  weaning solves this problem more effectively than abrupt weaning, but more
  research is needed to optimize the process. In a recent article appearing in
  the Journal of Dairy Science, scientists from the University of Guelph studied
  gradual weaning of 60 calves divided into four groups using two weaning
  programs and two feed placement locations.
