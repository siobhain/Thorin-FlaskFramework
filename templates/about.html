  Dairy producers are feeding dairy calves more milk before weaning, as research
  has demonstrated that greater milk consumption provides short- and long-term
  benefits for calves. Encouraging solid feed consumption by calves on high-milk
  diets, however, can be challenging. Researchers have concluded that gradual
  weaning solves this problem more effectively than abrupt weaning, but more
  research is needed to optimize the process. In a recent article appearing in
  the Journal of Dairy Science, scientists from the University of Guelph studied
  gradual weaning of 60 calves divided into four groups using two weaning
  programs and two feed placement locations.

      It is unknown whether a step-wise reduction in milk consumption during
      gradual weaning is better than a more continuous reduction. "It was
      predicted that small, frequent reductions in milk would be a more natural
      weaning process and cause less stress," said lead investigator Trevor
      DeVries, Ph.D., Department of Animal Biosciences, University of Guelph,
      Guelph, ON, Canada. "Therefore, reducing milk by larger quantities in a
      step-wise weaning program may be more noticeable to the calf and result in
      more behavioral indicators of stress, such as increased activity and
      vocalizations." Improving weaning transition, optimizing solid feed intake
      to prepare for a solid diet, increasing weight gain, and reducing stress
      are all important considerations.
